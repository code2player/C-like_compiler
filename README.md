# C-like_compiler

A c-like compiler used to translate c-like program language to MIPS asm code.

The code generated can be used in other hardware courses, such as Computer Architecture and its curriculum design. 
Just translate your c code to MIPS code, running it on your self-made CPU. 
You can find the CPU code and its report in my other repositories. 

At least it is enough to meet the silly requirements of some boring courses, best wishes for you.
